# cloudron-monitor

## Overview

Cloudron Monitor is a Python-based tool designed to enhance the monitoring capabilities of cloud instances. It makes it easier to receive notifications from Cloudron, send confirmed notifications to the messaging service, and mark notifications as confirmed in Cloudron. The script also checks the status of applications and informs about errors. The goal of this project is to provide an easy way to track the health and performance of cloud deployments, ensuring that users are informed of any important updates or issues.

## Features

- **Notification Fetching**: Automatically fetches notifications from Cloudron using the Cloudron API.
- **Application status**: Automatically fetches a list of apps and check status from Cloudron using the Cloudron API.
- **Message Sending**: Sends unacknowledged notifications and errors to a messaging service via a bash command.
- **Notification Acknowledgement**: Marks notifications as acknowledged in Cloudron, ensuring that they are not reprocessed.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Access to a Cloudron instance with API access enabled.
- A messaging service that can receive messages via cURL.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cloudron-monitor.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd cloudron-monitor
```

3. Install the required Python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Change the settings in the `setting.ini` file using the instructions provided in the accompanying file.


## Usage

To run the Cloudron Monitor, simply execute the `cloudron_monitor.py` script:
```
python cloudron_monitor.py
```

This script does not require any command-line arguments. It will automatically fetch unacknowledged notifications and application status from Cloudron. It send notifications to the configured messaging service, and mark them as acknowledged in Cloudron.

You can configure the script together with cron.

All successful commands and errors are logged to the corresponding output streams: `stdout` for successful commands and `stderr` for errors. This ensures that the monitoring process is transparent and that any issues can be easily identified and addressed.
